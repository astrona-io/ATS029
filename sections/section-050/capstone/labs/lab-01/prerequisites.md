# Prerequisites

- The `astrona` command-line tool, installed and working (`astrona check` passes).
- A container engine that kind can use (Podman or Docker) with about 2 GiB of free memory.
- `kubectl` and `jq`.
- You know requests and limits, QoS classes, how init containers and sidecars add up, and what a LimitRange and a ResourceQuota do.

The lab starts a single-node kind cluster (Kubernetes 1.35) with the `starfleet` namespace.
